"# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh — Safety (Arrest Data)\n",
"\n",
"**Member:** Sebastian Ribault  \n",
"**Dataset:** `arrests.csv` (uploaded)\n",
"\n",
"---\n",
"\n",
"## Introduction\n",
"This notebook evaluates neighborhood safety using the arrest dataset. The goal is to explore *what offenses are most common*, *how arrests vary across neighborhoods and over time*, and to derive a simple, reproducible **Safety Score** based only on arrests (a proxy for public safety). This mirrors the structure you saw in Kade's example, but uses your dataset and fully runnable code cells.\n",
"\n",
"**Important caveats**\n",
"- Arrests are **not** crimes: some crimes do not lead to arrests, and policing intensity varies by area.\n",
"- Population differences strongly affect counts; if population data is not joined, treat rankings as *activity* rather than true *rates*.\n",
"\n",
"---\n",
"\n",
"## What you'll see\n",
"1. Quick peek at the data (columns, sample rows)\n",
"2. Most common offenses (table + chart)\n",
"3. Arrests by neighborhood (table + chart)\n",
"4. Arrests over time (if a date column exists)\n",
"5. A simple **Safety Score** per neighborhood (lower arrests → higher score)\n",
"6. Summary statistics and reflection prompts\n"
